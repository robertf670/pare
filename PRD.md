## Executive Summary

**Pare** is a minimalist daily task management app that solves the core problem of daily overwhelm through radical simplicity. Unlike cluttered productivity apps, Pare focuses on **today's tasks only** - helping users maintain clarity and momentum without the complexity of projects, tags, or endless categorization.

**Core Philosophy:** "Less is more productive."

### Key Objectives
- **Eliminate Daily Overwhelm**: Focus on today's essential tasks only
- **Speed Over Features**: Lightning-fast task entry and completion
- **Visual Clarity**: Time-prominent, distraction-free interface
- **Habit Formation**: Encourage consistent daily task completion

### The Problem We Solve
Most productivity apps suffer from **feature bloat** - projects, tags, due dates, priorities, categories. Users spend more time organizing than doing. Pare removes the friction: **What needs to happen today?**

---

## Product Overview

### Vision Statement
"The fastest way to capture and complete your daily tasks, without the clutter."

### Mission
Pare eliminates productivity app overwhelm by focusing exclusively on daily task completion. We believe that most people don't need complex project management - they need a simple way to remember and complete today's essentials.

### Core Values
- **Simplicity First**: Every feature must justify its existence
- **Speed**: Task entry and completion in under 3 seconds
- **Daily Focus**: No past regrets, no distant futures - just today
- **Visual Calm**: Interface promotes focus, not anxiety
